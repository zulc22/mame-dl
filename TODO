Parse MAMExml for
{
	machine.attr('name'): {
		"storedin": machine.attr('cloneof')? || machine.attr('name'),
		"requires": machine.attr('romof')?,
		"displayname": machine.childNode('description'),
		"year": machine.childNode('year')?,
		"manufacturer": machine.childNode('manufacturer')?
	}
}

make GUI and browser userscript that hooks into arcadeitalia http://adb.arcadeitalia.net/
